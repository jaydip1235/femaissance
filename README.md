# INSPIRATHON'22
## Problem statement 
“Healthcare accessibility isn’t a privilege to women- it is a basic need and should be a priority”

Nowadays women are at par with men in all spheres of life, they are working as
successful doctors, engineers, professionals, entrepreneurs etc. Women do not feel free
to talk about their health. In some cases it becomes life-threatening. Talking about
women related health issues is still a big taboo in most parts of India. Participants are
required to find a technical solution to solve the above

## Inspiration behind Femaissance
 
Everyone talks about the miracle of childbirth and pregnancy 
glows, but not many speak about the never-ending aches and 
pains, and insomnia that go along with it. A woman’s body goes
through a lot during pregnancy, and while the female body is
built to handle such a miraculous event, it is by no means a 
comfortable experience to go through. Even healthy women can 
experience problems during pregnancy and after that as well. 
It is just something that happens. While most pregnancy 
problems are common and experienced by expectant mothers, 
it is always best to keep your doctor updated on changes that
you may be experiencing and get advice.
 
So considering the issues every women comes across regardless
of being from urban or rural areas, we have come up with an 
initiative called Femaissance which would not only help women
to connect to each other and lift up their overwhelming 
changes but also connect and contact expertise across the globe.
 
This platform would give freedom to its users to post ,like,chat
comment and share to increase awareness among all womens.
